- MUST DO: ALWAYS FOLLOW THE BEST PRACTICES TO IMPLEMENT ANY FEATURE OR RESOLVE ANY PROBLEM. 

## Code Quality
- Prioritize correctness; strict TypeScript (no `any`)
- Functions <30 lines; use pure helpers and early returns
- Fix all lint errors before committing
- Use useCallback, useMemo to optimise code based on best practices
- Use useContext to prevent props drilling
- Always try the popular and well-maintained package to solve the problem first.

## File Structure
- PascalCase components/classes; kebab-case for app/page routes
- Single default export per file; CSS Modules only
- Break large components into smaller, focused pieces

## Naming & Style
- camelCase variables/functions; UPPERCASE env vars
- Use `const` for literals; descriptive variable names
- Self-documenting code; comment only complex logic or "why" decisions

## Development
- Incremental edits over bulk changes
- Use PowerShell for terminal commands


- Auto-apply style rules without prompting
